**Problem 1 :** 

Define an R function that removes NA values from a vector.

**Problem 2 :** 

Define an R function that computes the factorial of a given integer arguement. The output should be a vector of length 1 take input from the user

**Problem 3:** 

Define an R function that computes the determinant of a given matrix.  The output should be a vector of length 1

**Problem 4:** 

Define an R function that sorts a given vector in decreasing order. The output should be a vector of the same length. It should accept both numeric and character vector 

**Problem 8:**
